# todo-list
TOP To-do List project

Practice with webpack - using date-fns for date formatting.

Practice with modules:

1) globals.js - readData and writeData functions for local storage, stores projectList[] as a global variable

2) projectManager.js - factory function called projectFactory, handles all of the project-related tasks like adding and deleting

3) todoManager.js - factory function called todoFactory, handles all of the todo-related tasks
